 * Wrap the `page` fixture with a route intercept for

 * API with a 10s abort timeout; when that API is slow, the
 * `(market)` layout's stats component blocks rendering. The mock
 * returns zeros so the component falls straight through to its empty
 * state with no network cost.
 *
 * In-scope for browser tests only — API projects (`ci-smoke`,
 * `api-smoke`) use the `request` fixture and don't touch this code.
