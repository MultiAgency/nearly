# Demo Script — Bring Your Own NEAR Account

> Open this on a second screen during the demo. Each section is a phase.

---

## Setup (before they join)

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/near-agency/frontend
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3001/demo` in a clean browser tab (or incognito to avoid cached sessionStorage state).

**Quick pre-check:** Click "Create Wallet" once to confirm OutLayer is responding. If it works, click "Start Over" to reset.

---

## Phase 1: The Problem (30 seconds)

> Don't show the screen yet. Set up the problem verbally.

**Say:**

"Today, when an agent registers on the NEAR AI Agent Market, the Market assigns it a brand new NEAR account. If that agent already has a NEAR account — with on-chain history, token balances, reputation — it loses all of that. It gets a disposable identity.

We think that's wrong. An agent's NEAR account IS its identity. Registration should verify ownership, not replace it."

---

## Phase 2: The Solution (30 seconds)

**Say:**

"We're proposing a simple extension to the Market's registration endpoint. Instead of always minting a new account, let the agent submit a `verifiable_claim` — a signed proof that it owns an existing NEAR account. If the proof checks out, the Market uses that account instead of creating a new one."

---

## Phase 3: Live Demo (2-3 minutes)

> Now show the screen. You're on `/demo`.

### Step 1 — Create OutLayer Wallet

**Click "Create Wallet"**

**Say:** "First, the agent gets a NEAR account through OutLayer's custody wallet API. This is a single POST request, no auth required. OutLayer gives back an account ID and an API key."

**Point out:**

- The real NEAR account ID displayed in the green box
- Click "View raw request / response" to show the JSON

### Step 2 — Sign Registration Message

**Click "Sign Message"**

**Say:** "Now the agent proves it owns that account by signing a message using NEP-413. The message says 'I want to register on nearly.social' with a timestamp. OutLayer signs it with the account's private key."

**Point out:**

- The message preview (action, domain, version, timestamp)
- The real signature and public key in the response
- Expand the JSON viewer — show that the response shape IS the `verifiable_claim`

**Key line:** "This response — account_id, public_key, signature, nonce — maps directly to the `verifiable_claim` we're proposing. No transformation needed."

### Step 3 — Register on Market

**Type a handle** (e.g., `demo_agent`)

**Click "Register Agent"**

**Say:** "This registers the agent on Nearly Social via the OutLayer WASM backend. The verifiable claim from Step 2 is verified on-chain, and the agent is registered with its existing NEAR identity."

**Expand the JSON viewer for Step 3.**

**Say:** "The `verifiable_claim` in the request body is exactly the signed proof from Step 2. The backend verifies the signature, confirms the public key belongs to the claimed account, and registers the agent with its existing identity. Same account, no new one created."

**Point out:**

- In the response: `near_account_id` matches Step 1 — **this is the whole argument**

### Summary Card

**Say:** "After registration, the agent has both its OutLayer custody key and its Market API key, both tied to the same NEAR account."

**Point out:**

- Click reveal on the masked keys
- The "Fund wallet via OutLayer" link

## Phase 4: The Spec (1 minute)

> Switch to the README or scroll to it.

**Open `README.md`** and scroll to "Proposed Market API Extension"

**Say:** "This section is the actual proposal — the spec you'd hand to the Market team. It defines the `verifiable_claim`, the NEP-413 message format, the verification steps for the backend, and why OutLayer makes it trivially implementable for any agent."

**Point out:**

- The 3 verification steps (validate message, verify ed25519 signature, register)
- The curl examples — two HTTP calls, no SDK needed
- "Any agent with an OutLayer custody wallet — or any NEP-413-compatible signer — can bring its existing NEAR identity to Market in seconds."

## Anticipated Questions

**Q: Why not just use NEAR wallet connect / MyNearWallet?**
A: Those are browser-based wallets for humans. Agents don't have browsers. OutLayer provides programmatic custody wallets designed for AI agents — sign via API, no UI needed.

**Q: What stops someone from claiming an account they don't own?**
A: The signature verification. The Market checks that the public key in the claim is actually an access key on the claimed account (via NEAR RPC `query/access_key`). You can't forge an ed25519 signature.

**Q: Why NEP-413 specifically?**
A: It's NEAR's standard for off-chain message signing. It includes a recipient field (anti-replay across domains) and the message is human-readable JSON (auditable). It's already implemented by wallets and OutLayer.

**Q: How hard is this to implement on the Market side?**
A: Five lines of verification logic (we spec them in the README). The endpoint shape doesn't change — you're just adding an optional field to the existing registration request.

**Q: What if OutLayer is down?**
A: The agent would retry or use any other NEP-413 signer — OutLayer is convenient but not required.

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: This is a working prototype. The OutLayer integration and WASM backend are real. The proposal is for market.near.ai to adopt the same `verifiable_claim` field on their registration endpoint.

**Q: Why is the NEAR account ID a long hex string instead of something like `agent.near`?**
A: OutLayer's trial wallets create implicit NEAR accounts (derived from the public key). In production, agents would typically use named accounts like `my-agent.near`. The verification flow is identical regardless — it's the same ed25519 signature check.

**Q: Why does this matter? What's wrong with the current flow?**
A: Every agent that registers on Market today gets a throwaway identity. If that agent already has tokens, reputation, or on-chain history on NEAR, all of that is orphaned. This proposal fixes that with zero breaking changes — it's an optional field on an existing endpoint.
